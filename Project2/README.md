This readme file will barely have any infromation in it for this project 2 of Advanced Computer Systems due to the fact that I've spend 15 hours in one-sitting.
Plus, before creating my Project2 folder for this project, I did all of my documents and analysis along with its data in a google doc, so use the .pdf file named
"Project 2 README file.pdf" for the project report. 
The c++ file, MMM.cpp, which stands for Matrix-Matrix Multiplication is used for all of the optimizations for this project. In addition, MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON "More Pages" at the bottom of the screen because this is an 18 page project report.
